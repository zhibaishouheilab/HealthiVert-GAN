# HealthiVert-GAN
HealthiVert-GAN, a novel deep-learning framework designed to generate pseudo-healthy vertebral images. These images simulate the pre-fractured state of vertebrae, offering a potential improvement in diagnosis. The HealthiVert-GAN utilizes a coarse to fine, 2.5D synthesis network based on generative adversarial networks (GAN).
